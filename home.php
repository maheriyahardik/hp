                                          <p> star as none is not an option, brought an envy printer and instant ink 
                                             ,they had to change printer as only printing half pages eventually as support are
                                              useless,new one arrived and still same problem ,again support are useless ,there stock 
                                              answer is to change ink cartridge or try different things that didn't work before,many times .

                                          <p>I own Elitebook for my daily work 50-60 hours a week, it is 2.5 years old machine already 
                                             visited official service 2 times due to warranty issue.
                                             Now, there is electricity shock on the computer whenever somebody touches me if I am working.
                                             CS team tried to escalate the case but local representatives only follow official guidline,
                                             "go and check with nearest service since warranty is over' What?! a computer is 5 months after
                                              warranty expired and they cannot even make diagnostic on such a safety issue. Avoid ! I would 
                                              spare this one to another brand. They better focus on product not FB posts and such.</p>
